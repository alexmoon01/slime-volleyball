# Slime Volleyball
It's a slime volleyball game. Mostly experimental to see just how bad the fabled Java graphics API is. WIP, if you use it now be warned it does precisely nothing.

# Goals:
1. Use java.awt and javax.swing to create a basic applet. DONE
2. Implement keyboard input for slimes. DONE
3. Implement collision detection betweens the slimes and the ball. DONE
4. Create a functioning two player slime volleyball game. DONE
4. (End reach goal, deserving of its own project) Create an AI that can play the game at its most basic level. NOT EVEN TRYING YET
